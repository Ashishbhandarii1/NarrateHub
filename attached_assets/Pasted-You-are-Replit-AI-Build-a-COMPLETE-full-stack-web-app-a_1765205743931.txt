You are Replit AI. Build a COMPLETE full-stack web app as a Replit project using:

- Backend: Python (Flask)
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Database: MySQL
- Theme: strictly black and white (with gray tones), modern, minimal
- Effects: smooth animations for page transitions, hover effects, and content cards

The project is a narrated content library with login and a hidden admin area.

================================
CORE CONCEPT
================================
Build a website that hosts multiple types of written content:

- Stories
- News
- Poems
- Dialogues
- Life Stories
- History Bites

Each content item has:

- Title
- Category (one of: story, news, poem, dialogue, life, history)
- Full text
- Language (e.g. English, Hindi, Hinglish)
- Tags (e.g. “motivational”, “romantic”, “historic”)
- Created_at timestamp

Users can read the text and also click a “Play” button to have the browser narrate the content in a female voice using the Web Speech API (client-side text-to-speech).

Include a basic user login system. Also include a hidden admin login with a secret URL and a password lock "admin123" (checked on the backend, not visible in frontend code). The admin can add/edit/delete content from a dashboard that is never linked from the public UI.

================================
TECH + STRUCTURE
================================
Use this structure:

- main.py (Flask app entrypoint)
- config.py (DB config, secret keys)
- requirements.txt
- templates/
  - base.html
  - index.html
  - content_detail.html
  - login.html
  - signup.html
  - secret_admin_login.html
  - admin_dashboard.html
  - admin_edit_content.html (for add/edit content)
- static/css/
  - style.css
- static/js/
  - main.js
  - tts.js (for speech)
  - animations.js (for scroll/hover animations)

Set up Flask with:

- Jinja2 templating
- Session-based auth
- MySQL connection using a library like mysql-connector-python or SQLAlchemy

================================
DATABASE SCHEMA (MySQL)
================================

Create these tables:

1) users
   - id (INT, PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
   - name (VARCHAR)
   - email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE)
   - password_hash (VARCHAR)  // use proper hashing in Python
   - role (ENUM('USER','ADMIN') DEFAULT 'USER')
   - created_at (DATETIME)

2) content
   - id (INT, PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
   - title (VARCHAR)
   - category (ENUM('story','news','poem','dialogue','life','history'))
   - language (VARCHAR)
   - tags (VARCHAR)  // comma-separated tags
   - body (TEXT)
   - created_at (DATETIME)
   - updated_at (DATETIME)

Optionally add:

3) user_favorites
   - id (INT, PK, AUTO_INCREMENT)
   - user_id (INT, FK -> users.id)
   - content_id (INT, FK -> content.id)
   - created_at (DATETIME)

================================
ROUTING & FEATURES
================================

Flask routes to implement:

Public routes:
- GET / 
  - Show homepage with sections and feeds of content
  - Sections on the page:
    - “Latest Content”
    - “Stories”
    - “Poems”
    - “Life Stories”
    - “History Bites”
  - Each content item appears as a card with:
    - Title
    - Category
    - Short preview of text
    - “Read / Listen” button that links to its detail page
  - Add subtle black/white hover animations on cards

- GET /content/<int:content_id>
  - Content detail page
  - Shows:
    - Title
    - Category
    - Language
    - Tags
    - Created date
    - Full text
    - A prominent “Play” button (for narration)
  - The Play button calls JavaScript that uses the Web Speech API to speak the text in a female voice:
    - Choose a female voice if available
    - Controls: play, pause, resume, stop
  - Show a few “Related content” suggestions at the bottom based on same category or tags.

- GET /login
  - Login form for normal users.
  - Fields: email, password.
- POST /login
  - Authenticate user, start session, redirect to home or “My Library”.

- GET /signup
  - Signup form: name, email, password, confirm password.
- POST /signup
  - Create a new user with hashed password in DB.

- GET /logout
  - Clear session and redirect to home.

- GET /my-library  (only for logged-in users)
  - Simple page that shows:
    - Maybe “Recently viewed” or “Favorite content” if you implement favorites.
  - If you use the favorites table, show a list of saved content here.

Hidden admin routes:

Important: The admin UI MUST NOT be visible or linked from any normal page. No “Admin” link in navbar or footer.

- GET /secret-admin-login
  - A minimal page (template: secret_admin_login.html) with just:
    - “Admin Password” field
    - Submit button
  - This URL is the only entry point to admin login.
- POST /secret-admin-login
  - Check the posted password against a constant stored on the server (e.g., in config.py):
      ADMIN_PASSWORD = "admin123"
  - If password matches:
      - Set a session key like session["is_admin"] = True
      - Redirect to /admin/dashboard
  - If not:
      - Reload page with error message “Invalid admin password”.

- GET /admin/dashboard
  - Only accessible if session["is_admin"] is True.
  - If not admin, redirect to home or show 404.
  - Show:
    - List of all content items (title, category, created_at).
    - Buttons/links: “Add new content”, “Edit”, “Delete”.

- GET /admin/content/new
  - Form to create a new content item:
    - title, category (dropdown), language, tags, body (textarea).
- POST /admin/content/new
  - Insert into DB, then redirect to /admin/dashboard.

- GET /admin/content/<int:content_id>/edit
  - Edit form with current data pre-filled.
- POST /admin/content/<int:content_id>/edit
  - Update the DB row, redirect back.

- POST /admin/content/<int:content_id>/delete
  - Delete the row and redirect to /admin/dashboard.

All /admin/* routes must verify session["is_admin"] and block non-admin users.

================================
FRONTEND DESIGN & THEME
================================

Global rules:

- Strictly black, white, and grayscale only.
  - Backgrounds: white or near-white.
  - Text: mostly black, with some gray for secondary text.
  - Borders/shadows: subtle gray.
- Use a clean, sans-serif font (e.g. system font stack).
- Layout:
  - A centered content wrapper with max-width.
  - Responsive design for desktop and mobile.
- Navbar:
  - Top bar with site name on left.
  - On right: Home, Explore, Login/Signup or Profile/Logout.
  - No link to admin anywhere.

Animations:

- On homepage, content cards should:
  - Slightly scale up and elevate on hover.
  - Use CSS transition for transform and box-shadow.
- On scroll, fade-in and slide-up sections:
  - Implement using Intersection Observer in animations.js.
- For buttons:
  - Subtle background and border animations on hover.

================================
TEXT-TO-SPEECH (TTS) IMPLEMENTATION
================================

Use the browser’s Web Speech API on the frontend, in static/js/tts.js.

Behavior:

- On the content_detail page, include:
  - A Play button.
  - Optionally: Pause/Resume/Stop buttons.
- JS should:
  - Extract the full text of the content (from a hidden <div> or data attribute).
  - Use `speechSynthesis` and `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`.
  - Pick a female voice if available:
    - Iterate through `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` and choose the first voice where name or lang suggests a female voice.
    - If none found, just use the default voice.
  - Support:
    - Start reading from the beginning on Play.
    - Pause and resume.
    - Stop cancels the utterance.

UI should visually show when reading is active (e.g. change button state).

================================
AUTH & SECURITY BASICS
================================

- Use Flask sessions with a SECRET_KEY.
- Hash passwords using a secure method (e.g. werkzeug.security.generate_password_hash and check_password_hash).
- Protect user-only routes:
  - If user is not logged in, redirect to /login.
- Protect admin-only routes:
  - Check session["is_admin"] before loading any admin page.
  - Do NOT expose admin password in any JS or HTML; the string "admin123" must appear only in backend Python code or environment variables, not client-side.

================================
ANIMATIONS & UX DETAILS
================================

Implement in CSS and JS:

- Smooth scrolling for internal links.
- Card hover:
  - transform: scale(1.02);
  - box-shadow: subtle.
- Section entry animation:
  - Using Intersection Observer:
    - Add class like "section-hidden" initially.
    - On intersect, replace with "section-visible" that has opacity:1 and translateY:0 with transition.

Make sure animations are not too heavy and the site remains usable with animations disabled.

================================
EXTRA POLISH
================================

- Add a simple footer with:
  - Site name, year, and maybe text like “A narrated library of stories and more.”
- Implement basic server-side form validation and show error messages in templates.
- Show success/error flash messages using Flask’s flash() for login, signup, and admin actions.
- Make sure templates extend base.html and reuse layout properly.
- Ensure all pages are responsive.

================================
